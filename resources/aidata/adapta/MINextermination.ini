#The influence maps. See AdaptaEnums.h. STD_ATTACK (1) and STD_DANGER (2) are 2 standard influence maps, which are weighted by the module with training but their computation is fixed. The CUSTOM_N (3) one uses a custom set of weights for each unit and is weighted as well itself. A custom map will tipically increase the complexity a lot since it needs UnitList x UnitListVs additional weights
#NONE is a special tag which tells to have a slot empty.
UnitInfluenceMaps=STD_ATTACK, STD_DANGER, CUSTOM_1
#A global influence map is computed only once, then it can be used by all units
